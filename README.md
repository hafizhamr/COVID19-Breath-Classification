# COVID-19 Breath Classification

This project is a team effort in EUREKA ITB 2022 national competition that was held by Student Association of Physics of Institut Teknologi Bandung (HIMAFI ITB). The theme of this competition is "Physics: Creative Ways to Deal with Current Issues".

This COVID-19 Breath Classification is using deep learning with BiLSTM architecture. The dataset that we use to train and test the model was based on The Coswara Dataset from [20220224](https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data/tree/master/20220224) file. Only the audio files with the label "breathing-shallow" from each subject was used to train this model.
